getTranslation: number number -> matrix
Purpose: Number1 and Number2 represent the displacement (in x and y, respectively) to shift a shape from the origin.
getTranslation uses these numbers to create a 3X3 matrix that will translate an object stored as a 3XN matrix when it multiplies the object matrix.
Dependencies: none
call: T = getTranslation(4, 5) -> (1, 0, 4; 0, 1, 5; 0, 0, 1]
